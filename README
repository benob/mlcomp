MLcomp is a website for automatic and standarized execution of algorithms on datasets.

The actual website is here:
  http://mlcomp.org

NOTE: always source the rc file (run . ./rc in bash) before running any of the following commands.

--- Installation
  sudo apt-get install mysql-server rake rubygems libopenssl-ruby # (for Debian)
  sudo gem install -v=2.1.1 rails
  sudo gem install json
  sudo gem install rails_sql_views-0.7.0.gem
  <Set up your ssh keys so that you can ssh into localhost (or wherever the worker is running) without typing a password.>
    (run ssh-keygen on the master and add .ssh/id_rsa.pub to .ssh/authorized_keys on the worker)
  ./init-db
  ./seed-db

--- To run MLcomp, start the following processes (in different terminals):
  ./run-server # Starts the Rails web server (on port 3000 by default)
  ./run-master # Starts the run master (communicates with workers to run jobs)
  cd worker && ./worker -server localhost # Starts up a worker
  ./run-stats # Starts a process that computes general statistics and updates the database (optional)

--- Relevant directories
  site: where the Rails webserver and code reside
  var: things which have been uploaded sit here (with corresponding entries in the database)
  domains: specification files for each domain in system along with helper programs and sample datasets to be uploaded.

--- When updating the system from the repository:
  git pull
  cd site && ./update-db # Update database

--- Handy database commands
  mysql -u rails_user mlcomp_development # inspect it
  mysqldump -u rails_user mlcomp_development > mlcomp_development.backup # dump contents
